# Todo
A simple todo list
On opening the app, the user is presented with three options. A text entry, a button for adding the entry, and a button to delete all entries.
To add an item, type in the item name in the text box and click 'Add item'. The item will appear as a check box. Additional items can also be added.
To reset the list, click 'Delete all'. This will delete all checkboxes to create and empty list.
